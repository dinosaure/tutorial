=How to create a form wizard (sequence of pages depending on data entered on previous ones)?=

The solution to implement wizard-like forms (that is a sequence of pages 
depending on data entered on previous ones) is the create dynamically new 
services especially for one user. If you use session data (eliom references) 
it won't work if you have several tabs on the same site (or if you use the 
back button).

Just create new anonymous (attached)-coservices that depend on the data sent 
by the user. In the following example (taken from Eliom's testsuite), I create 
a two step wizard that will add two integers. You can try to enter a first 
value, duplicate the tab, and both will continue working correctly.

To prevent memory leaks, use a timeout for these dynamic coservices.
The scope of these service can be session or global for the site (as coservice 
identifiers are cryptographically safe).

(* -------------------------------------------------------- *)
(* We create two main services on the same URL,             *)
(* one with a GET integer parameter:                        *)

let calc = service ~path:["calc"] ~get_params:unit ()
let calc_i = service ~path:["calc"] ~get_params:(int "i") ()


(* -------------------------------------------------------- *)
(* The handler for the service without parameter.           *)
(* It displays a form where you can write an integer value: *)

let calc_handler () () =
  let create_form intname =

  Lwt.return (html (head (title (pcdata "")) []) (body [f]))


(* -------------------------------------------------------- *)
(* The handler for the service with parameter.              *)

(* entered by the user.                                     *)
