=How to create a service sending JSON values?=

*If you want to communicate with a client side Eliom program, you do not need to serialize yourself your data to JSON. Serialization/Deserialization of any OCaml type is done automatically by Eliom. Just use OCaml services (or, simpler: server functions and call the function from your OCaml client side program).
*If you want to use your own JSON format, you need to have your own serialisation function to JSON (or for example to use some ocaml library like json-wheel to generate JSON). In that case, you can register your service using {{{Eliom_registration.String}}} instead of {{{Eliom_registration.Html5}}}. The handler function must return the JSON value as a string, and a the content-type.
*It is even possible to define yourself your own registration module, to be used instead of {{{Eliom_registration.String}}}. Thus, you can use an OCaml representation of the JSON value (and you don't call the serializer yourself). Have a look on how modules like {{{Eliom_registration.String}}} are implemented to know how to do that.
