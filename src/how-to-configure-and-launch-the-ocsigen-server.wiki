=How to configure and launch the Ocsigen Server?=

=== Default configuration file

* Copy the default configuration file provided with the installation of Ocsigen (ocsigenserver.conf.sample) and edit it.
* You can also use the one provided by [[https://github.com/db0company/Ocsigen-Quick-Howto/blob/master/.make/example.conf|the Ocsigen-Quick-Howto examples]].
* Change the port by the network port number you want your website to work on. The port **80** is the port used by http by default but you need to be the administrator of your server to use it.
* Change paths.
